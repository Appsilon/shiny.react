## Author comment

Submission of this version of the package breaks shiny.fluent and shiny.blueprint packages which depend on shiny.react due to the React upgrade.

The submission of shiny.react 0.4.0 will be followed by a submissions of shiny.fluent and shiny.blueprint, which will address compatibility issues.
